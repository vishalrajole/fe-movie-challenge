# Raisin FE tech challenge

Dear Candidate,

here you can find our detailed tech challenge for your kind consideration.
Please let us know if you would have any questions about our tech challenge.

Yours truly,  
Raisin.

## Concept: Website migration

The product oswner asks you for a rough concept for the migration of a public website that receives
content from a classic CMS (frontend and backend in one system), into a modern combination of a
headless CMS and single page application approach (front- and back-end separated). The migration
should be iterative and not to be launched in a big bang. Please mainly focus on the front-end part
of the concept . If you have specific requirements for the backend, you can have them integrated
into your plans.

### Task

Develop a technical project plan. What are the important issues to consider during the migration?
What are the single steps to successfully finish the project? What information do you need from
your product owner or other stakeholders?

### Implementation: Movie DB search module

In a next step, we would like you to develop a small application. For this, you receive a user story and some requirements:
“As a user, I would like to find relevant information about movies. Therefore, I expect a form, that helps me to search for a movie and provides relevant information in a result list. Sometimes I search for a movie, but I do not know the correct name and only remember some parts of the title or the author etc.“

### Requirements

- You use an open and public movie API
- You decide which information is shown in the result list
- You use a frontend framework/library of your choice that best fits the needs for these requirements (if needed). Vanilla JavaScript is fine as well
- Build a nice structured app architecture and don’t use any CLI generator for building the structure and setup
- You decide about the look and appearance
- You hand over a component (dependency) diagram
- (optional: users want to be excited; which features, that go beyond the original scope of the challenge, can you imagine? If possible, pick 1 or 2 of them and implement it as well)

### User demographics

- Age: 45 % :18-24, 30 % : 25-32, 25 % :32+
- Device: 40 % smartphone, 20 % tablet, 40 % desktop
- Gender: 30 % female, 70 % male
